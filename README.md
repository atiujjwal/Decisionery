# Decisionery 🎲

An elegant and modern web application designed to help you make decisions when you're feeling indecisive. Create lists of options, and let **Decisionery** pick one for you with a satisfying animated reveal.

## Features

The application includes:
- **List Management:** Create, edit, and delete multiple lists of choices.
- **Random Decision Making:** Select a list and click the "Decide for Me" button to get a random choice.
- **Animated Results:** An exciting "rolling" animation cycles through options before revealing the final choice.
- **Persistent Storage:** Your lists are saved in the browser's `localStorage`, so they're available when you return.
- **Decision History:** Keep track of your past decisions in a collapsible history panel.
- **Modern UI/UX:** A stunning glassmorphism design with dynamic background animations and a responsive layout.
- **Default Example:** Comes with a pre-built, locked list ("What to Eat? 🍕") to demonstrate functionality.

## How to Use

1.  **Create a List:** Click the "**+ New List**" button.
2.  **Add Details:** Give your list a title (e.g., "Movies to Watch") and add at least two options.
3.  **Save:** Click "**Save Changes**".
4.  **Make a Decision:** With your new list selected in the sidebar, click the "**DECIDE FOR ME**" button.
5.  **View the Result:** Watch the animation as it settles on a final choice!
6.  **Check History:** Expand the "History" section to see your recent decisions.
